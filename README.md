Driver Drowsiness Detection System with OpenCV & Keras
With this intermediate-level Python project, we will be making a drowsiness detecting device. A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep. Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy.

The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. So, to prevent these accidents we will build a system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy.

DataFlair has also published other Python project ideas with source code. You can check them from this Python projects list:
